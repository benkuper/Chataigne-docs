# Conductor

A conductor let's you create a cue list of sequential actions. Each cue can trigger multiple consequences (like actions) or be linked to a sequence. The conductor keeps track of the current cue (purple background color) and the next cue (orange background color). When the conductor is triggered it will trigger the next cue and increment the current and next cues.
